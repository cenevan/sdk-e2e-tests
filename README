# SDK-E2E-Tests

This project dedicates to perform e2e test for the story protocol typescript sdk.

## Prerequisites to run the e2e test

- install nvm if don't have it by running:

  `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash`.

- run `nvm use` to switch node version to v20.0.0
- if you don't have v20.0.0 node installed, please install it by running: `nvm install v20.0.0`

- run `npm i` to install dependencies.
- once all dependencies are installed, you should config your `.env` file with a reference to the `.env.example` file

## How to run the test

- Run specific test (recommend):

        run `npm run test:flow1`

- Run all test together:

        run `npm run test`

## How can I extend test flows to this project

- wrap your test flow into a function and default export this function.
- put the new test file into `/test/e2e/flows`
- import the function from `/test/e2e/e2e.ts`, and register it into `flowsTestMap`
- extend the `scripts` field of the `/package.json` file with a reference to the existing other scrip command, and finally add the flow name to `TEST_FLOWS` in 'test' of the 'scripts'
